A radiophysics student currently employed as Procurement Manager passionately learning Web Development.

My journey started as a Back-End Dev student of <a href="https://practicum.yandex.ru/">Yandex Practicum</a>. I felt out of place since most of the students with whom I had to cooperate for some tasks did not show same interest and motivation.

I decided to leave and proceed on my own. My first personal pet project was ecommerce site built with Django. However I lacked some fundamental knowledge of CSS, JS.

This is where I stumbled across <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>. This helped me so much in understanding Web Dev and I continue forward in learning new things with it!
