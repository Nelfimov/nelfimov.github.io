### Hobbies (or rather, obsessions)

- **German** — TestDaF C1 (for studying in Germany). Took part in two national school olympiads. I don’t confuse “can read” with real proficiency.
- **English** — no issues with documentation, real-world spoken communication, and business writing with international teams and clients.
- `Vim` as a way of thinking. GUI-driven workflows slow people down.
- Split keyboards — standard keyboards are ergonomically hostile.
- Podcasts: _Organized Programming_, _Self-Directed Research_.
- Beach volleyball.
- CrossFit.
