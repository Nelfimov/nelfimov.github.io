### DevOps (because throwing code over the wall is broken by design)

- Kubernetes infrastructure in cloud and bare metal — `Terraform`, `Ansible`. Snowflake servers are unacceptable.
- CI/CD pipelines — `GitHub Actions`, `Jenkins`. Manual releases are a smell.
- Building service images and fixing bloated, slow `Dockerfiles`.
- Monitoring clusters and servers via `Grafana Alloy`, log parsing for `Loki`, alerting and dashboards — blind systems are dangerous.
- Load testing with `k6` — guessing performance is not engineering.
