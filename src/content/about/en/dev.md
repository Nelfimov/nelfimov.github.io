### Fullstack development

- Frontend: `React` (`Next.js`, `Astro`). Vanilla `JS` when frameworks just get in the way.
- Backend: `Node.js` (`NestJS`). `Rust` (`axum`) when performance and correctness actually matter.

I actively participate in Open Source. Using OSS without contributing back is parasitism.
