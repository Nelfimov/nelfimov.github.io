- I don’t tolerate cargo-cult `SOLID` — only when it actually makes sense.
- I’m allergic to code without tests, `TDD` is the baseline.
- I dislike “architecture” that collapses on first change — I stick to Clean Architecture (Hexagonal, DDD).
- Manual infrastructure is a red flag — Infrastructure as Code or nothing.
- Loosely typed code is a long-term liability — strict typing only.

## What I do (and what I avoid doing badly)

### `Fullstack` development

- Frontend: `React` (`Next.js`, `Astro`). Vanilla `JS` when frameworks just get in the way.
- Backend: `Node.js` (`NestJS`). `Rust` when performance and correctness actually matter.

### `DevOps` (because throwing code over the wall is broken by design)

- Kubernetes infrastructure in cloud and bare metal — `Terraform`, `Ansible`. Snowflake servers are unacceptable.
- CI/CD pipelines — `GitHub Actions`, `Jenkins`. Manual releases are a smell.
- Building service images and fixing bloated, slow `Dockerfiles`.
- Monitoring clusters and servers via `Grafana Alloy`, log parsing for `Loki`, alerting and dashboards — blind systems are dangerous.
- Load testing with `k6` — guessing performance is not engineering.

I actively participate in `Open Source`. Using OSS without contributing back is parasitism.

### Languages

- German — TestDaF C1 (for studying in Germany). Took part in two national school olympiads. I don’t confuse “can read” with real proficiency.
- English — no issues with documentation, real-world spoken communication, and business writing with international teams and clients.

### Hobbies (or rather, obsessions)

- `Vim` as a way of thinking. GUI-driven workflows slow people down.
- Split keyboards — standard keyboards are ergonomically hostile.
- Podcasts: _Organized Programming_, _Self-Directed Research_.
- Beach volleyball.
- CrossFit.
